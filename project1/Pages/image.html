					<br/>
					<p>
					In Mauritius, when we speak of “the north”, Grand Bay is the first thing that comes to mind. 
					Grand Bay, through sustained development, has become the premier tourist destination of Mauritius.
					<br/><br/>
					
					The starting point of nautical trips to the northern islands and other sea activities, Grand Bay has two 
					beaches, one of which is “La Cuvette", a discreet hideaway, where you can still found the rare “tec-tec” hidden 
					in the sand, small white shells that need to be preserved.
					<br/><br/>
					
					Take a walk through the narrow streets behind the main road and enjoy what the small local 
					boutiques have to offer. Known for its wide variety of restaurants and its nightlife, you will 
					immediately be drawn to this charming and exuberant village.
					<br/><br/>
					
					Another picturesque village in the north of Mauritius is Cap Malheureux, with its famous 
					red-roofed church, its view of the northern islands and its important fishing community. 
					<br/><br/>

					<h2 style="text-align: center;">Sailing</h2>
					<br/><br/>
					
					<p>
						Grand Bay is the Mauritian sailing paradise thanks to its protected bay. 
						From there, one can join a yacht trip, a catamaran cruise or even rent a private sailing boat. 
						The conditions for sailing are ideal and yachts can be hired to navigate around Mauritius or to 
						visit some of the islands that lie off the north coast.
