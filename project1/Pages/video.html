					<h2>Pointe aux Sables</h2> <br/>

					<p>Albion is more of a residential area than a tourist spot but it has a public beach worth visiting, 
						and if you take a walk along the coast towards Club Med, you can have a lovely swim in the shade of 
						the trees which border the shore. Albion is also known for its lighthouse. 
					</p>
					
					<p>Not far, at Pointe aux Sables, you’ll find “Montagne Zako” 
						(Monkey Mount) where you can try a 20-metre-high cliff dive into the sea. 
						Check the water below and the wave movement carefully before making the jump! 
						It is definitely worth the detour. Adrenaline rush guaranteed!
					</p><br />
					
					 
					
					<h2>Flic en Flac</h2> <br />
					
					<p>If you want to relax on the beach, catch a tan and meet some 
						friendly locals, Flic en Flac is the place to be. With its 
						white beaches fringed with Casuarina trees, it is a popular location for 
						weekend beach activities such as swimming and snorkelling, and also has a wide 
						range of bungalows for rent. When you’re done soaking up the sun there are a number 
						of restaurants to choose from, and a lively nightlife.
					</p>
					
					<p>When the moon is full, the starry sky is clear and the rain 
						‘walks’ over the ocean far on the horizon, you can see a tiny 
						white moon-rainbow over the sea. Rub your eyes, blink hard and look again… Yes, it’s true!
					</p>
					
					 
					<br>
					<h2>Tamarin and Black River</h2><br/>
					
					<p>
					Tamarin and Black River were once simple villages inhabited by locals and fishermen, 
					but today they are quite different. Although it has been transformed by many luxury villas, 
					shopping centres and restaurants, Tamarin Bay remains a popular surfing spot, with a long left-hand 
					reef break and 10-foot swells.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					Part of the cultural landscape, the salt pans of Tamarin are a unique place to visit. 
					Due to the dry conditions of the area, Tamarin is the ideal place for salt making. Simply stop 
					your car on the side of the road and take a look!
					</p>
					
					<p>
					The bay of Black River is teaming with deep-sea fishing boats, skippered by professional 
					fishermen who have given their lives to the sea. Try your hand at fishing and see if you’re 
					lucky enough to catch some marlin or tuna.
