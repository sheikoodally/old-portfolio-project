					<h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome To Mauritius</h1>
					<br/><br/>
					<p><h2 style="text-align: center;"> Twain once wrote, 'Mauritius was made first and then heaven,<br> 
						heaven being copied after Mauritius'. He was right.</h2></p>
					<br/><br/>
					<p><h3>Mauritius: The best Africa destination you
						 know almost nothing about.</h1></p>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<p>
						It's also one of Africa's great destinations, 
						located in the middle of the turquoise Indian Ocean, 
						inhabited by a multi-racial, peaceful people, 
						covered in great golf courses, offering myriad water sports, 
						mountain trekking, hunting, birdwatching, luxurious resorts, 
						an old colonial capital, great food, three- and four-star hotels, 
						one of the world's best botanical gardens, good nightlife, 
						beautiful beach bars, UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 
						one of the oldest horseracing tracks in the world, 
						great sightseeing ... but we'll get to that in a little while.<br><br>
						
						First, I want to argue on behalf of the title of this article; 
						that this tropical island 2,000 miles off the southeast coast of Africa 
						does indeed provide a template for a model African travel destination.<br><br>
						
						When your island is surrounded by perfect white sand beaches, 
						themselves surrounded by the stunning blue Indian Ocean, and the center of 
						the island contains mountains and breathtaking scenery, 
						plus almost year-round sunshine, it's difficult to be miserable.<br><br>
						
						
						I lived in Mauritius for more than three and a half years until June 2010, 
						enjoying its scenery and also witnessing its democratic impetus firsthand. <br><br>
						
						
						Since gaining independence in 1968 there's never been a coup, 
						or military or populist uprising of any kind on this small Indian Ocean island 
						(just more than 2,000 square kilometres in size). <br><br>
						
						
						The population of almost 1.3 million is 68 percent Indian, but also comprises Creole, 
						Chinese, French, plus a smattering of English and South Africans.<br><br>
						
						
						Between them they speak English (the country's official language), French, Mauritian Creole, 
						Hindi, Tamil, Marathi, Bhojpuri and Hakka. <br><br>
						
						
						Often, the sound of the native Sega music (an Indian Ocean version of calypso) inspires 
						dancing and laughing on the beaches all night.<br><br>
						
						
						Participants refresh themselves with the local ice cold Phoenix beer, the occasional 
						Green Island rum and Coke and barbecue, freshly caught seafood like snapper, dorado, prawns, octopus and lobster.
						Yet any holiday on Mauritius needn't be a laze on the sand. <br><br>
						
						
						Living on Mauritius can also be cheap, with a modest one bedroom flat costing from US$320 a month, 
						car rental from US$350 a month and utility bills much cheaper than most countries. <br><br>
